- Temperature (0.1¬∞C resolution)
- Humidity (0.1% resolution)
- Battery voltage (mV)
- Device type detection (3-axis, T&H, combined)

## Installation

1. Open `BLE-WiFi-Gateway.ino` in Arduino IDE
2. Install required libraries (see Dependencies)
3. Upload to ESP32
4. Connect to `BLE-Gateway-Setup` WiFi network (password: `12345678`)
5. Navigate to `192.168.4.1` and configure WiFi and ThingsBoard credentials
6. Gateway will auto-connect and start scanning

## Configuration

On first boot or when config is missing:

1. Gateway creates WiFi AP: **`BLE-Gateway-Setup`**
2. Connect to it (password: `12345678`)
3. Navigate to `192.168.4.1` in your browser
4. Enter:
   - **WiFi SSID:** Your WiFi network name
   - **WiFi Password:** Your WiFi password (encrypted before storage)
   - **ThingsBoard MQTT Host:** e.g., `mqtt.thingsboard.cloud`
   - **Device Access Token:** Your gateway device token from ThingsBoard (encrypted before storage)
   - **Config URL (Optional):** Remote config server URL (e.g., `https://hoptech.co.nz/bgw-config/`)
   - **Config Username (Optional):** Username for config server authentication
   - **Config Password (Optional):** Password for config server (encrypted before storage)
5. Click "Save and Restart"

The configuration is stored in EEPROM with encryption and persists across reboots.

### Config URL Fallback

If MQTT connection fails, the gateway can automatically fetch updated configuration from a remote server. The config URL should return a JSON response with the following format:

```json
{
  "mqtt_host": "mqtt.thingsboard.cloud",
  "mqtt_token": "your-device-token",
  "device_token": "alternative-field-for-token"
}
```

The gateway will automatically use basic authentication if credentials are provided.

## OTA Firmware Updates

The gateway supports remote firmware updates via ThingsBoard.

### Method 1: Shared Attributes

Set these shared attributes on your gateway device in ThingsBoard:

```json
{
  "fw_title": "BLE-Gateway",
  "fw_version": "1.1.0",
  "fw_url": "https://your-server.com/firmware.bin",
  "fw_size": 920000,
  "fw_checksum": "sha256_hash_optional"
}
```

### Method 2: RPC Call

Send an RPC command to your gateway:

```json
{
  "method": "updateFirmware",
  "params": {
    "fw_title": "BLE-Gateway",
    "fw_version": "1.1.0",
    "fw_url": "https://your-server.com/firmware.bin",
    "fw_size": 920000
  }
}
```

### OTA Status Reporting

The gateway reports its firmware status via device attributes:

- `current_fw_title`: Current firmware name
- `current_fw_version`: Currently running version
- `fw_state`: Update status
  - `IDLE` - No update in progress
  - `DOWNLOADING` - Downloading firmware
  - `UPDATING` - Flashing firmware
  - `UPDATED` - Update complete (will reboot)
  - `FAILED` - Update failed
  - `UP_TO_DATE` - Already on latest version
- `fw_progress`: Progress percentage (0-100)

### Other RPC Commands

```json
// Get current firmware information
{
  "method": "getCurrentFirmware"
}

// Reboot the gateway
{
  "method": "reboot"
}
```

### Multi-threaded Architecture

The gateway uses FreeRTOS tasks for concurrent operation:

1. **MQTT Maintenance Task (Core 0, Priority 2)**
   - Maintains MQTT connection with keepalives
   - Handles automatic reconnection
   - Processes incoming messages and RPC commands
   - Sends periodic gateway status updates
   - Manages OTA update process

2. **BLE Scanning Task (Core 1, Priority 1)**
   - Continuously scans for BLE advertisements
   - Runs on dedicated core for optimal performance
   - Scans every 10 seconds with 5-second scan windows
   - Handles BLE device callbacks

3. **Message Processing Task (Core 0, Priority 1)**
   - Batches detected BLE devices
   - Sends telemetry to ThingsBoard every 60 seconds
   - Thread-safe access to shared data structures

### Data Flow

1. **Startup Sequence:**
   - Load configuration from EEPROM
   - Connect to WiFi (fallback to AP mode if failed)
   - Synchronize time with NTP servers
   - Connect to MQTT (fallback to config URL if failed)
   - Start FreeRTOS tasks

2. **BLE Scanning:** Gateway scans for BLE advertisements every 10 seconds (dedicated task)
3. **Parsing:** Advertisements are parsed based on service UUID and data format
4. **Deduplication:** Identical advertisements are filtered (only RSSI updated)
5. **Batching:** Detected devices are batched and sent every 60 seconds (processing task)
6. **MQTT Publishing:** (maintenance task)
   - Device connection messages (`v1/gateway/connect`)
   - Device attributes (`v1/gateway/attributes`)
   - Device telemetry (`v1/gateway/telemetry`)
7. **MQTT Keepalive:** Continuous connection monitoring and automatic reconnection
8. **OTA Updates:** Gateway listens for firmware update requests via MQTT

### Topics Used

- `v1/devices/me/attributes` - Gateway attributes and OTA status
- `v1/devices/me/rpc/request/+` - RPC commands (OTA, reboot, etc.)
- `v1/gateway/connect` - Connect BLE devices
- `v1/gateway/attributes` - BLE device attributes
- `v1/gateway/telemetry` - BLE device telemetry

## Configuration Options

### Adjustable Parameters

Edit these in the code to customize behavior:

```cpp
// BLE scanning
const int SCAN_TIME = 5;  // BLE scan duration (seconds)
unsigned long last_ble_scan = 0;
// Scan interval: 10000ms (10 seconds)

// Batch sending
const unsigned long BATCH_INTERVAL = 60000;  // 60 seconds

// MQTT reconnection
const unsigned long MQTT_FAIL_AP_TIMEOUT = 300000;  // 5 minutes

// Firmware version
#define FIRMWARE_VERSION "1.0.0"
#define FIRMWARE_TITLE "BLE-Gateway"

// WiFi AP credentials
WiFi.softAP("BLE-Gateway-Setup", "12345678");
```

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway Not Scanning BLE Devices

- Check ESP32 has BLE antenna connected
- Verify sensors are powered on and advertising
- Check Serial Monitor for BLE scan messages
- Ensure sensors are within range (~10m)

### Cannot Connect to Config Portal

- Disconnect from other WiFi networks
- Look for `BLE-Gateway-Setup` WiFi network
- Try forgetting the network and reconnecting
- Check if ESP32 LED is blinking (indicates AP mode)

### MQTT Connection Fails

- Verify ThingsBoard host is correct
- Check device access token is valid
- Ensure ThingsBoard device exists and is not deleted
- Check firewall allows outbound port 1883
- Verify WiFi has internet access

### OTA Update Fails

- Ensure firmware URL is accessible from ESP32
- Check firmware file is valid `.bin` format
- Verify firmware size fits in OTA partition (~1.4MB max)
- Check ESP32 has sufficient free heap memory
- Ensure WiFi connection is stable during update

### Sensors Not Appearing in ThingsBoard

- Check BLE advertisements are being received (Serial Monitor)
- Verify MQTT connection is active
- Check ThingsBoard gateway device has proper permissions
- Look for errors in ThingsBoard logs
- Ensure device types exist in ThingsBoard

### Config URL Fallback Not Working

- Verify config URL is accessible from ESP32
- Check HTTP response is valid JSON
- Ensure authentication credentials are correct (if used)
- Look for HTTP error codes in Serial Monitor
- Verify server accepts the device MAC address header

### Time Not Syncing

- Check NTP servers are accessible from your network
- Verify firewall allows UDP port 123
- Try alternative NTP servers
- Check Serial Monitor for NTP sync messages
- System will continue to operate without time sync

## Security Considerations

### Credentials Storage

- WiFi and MQTT credentials are stored in EEPROM
- Consider encrypting EEPROM data for production deployments
- Use strong WiFi passwords
- Rotate ThingsBoard access tokens periodically

### Network Security

- Use MQTT over TLS (port 8883) for production
- Consider VPN for remote gateway deployments
- Implement firewall rules to restrict access
- Use private WiFi networks when possible

### OTA Security

- **Always use HTTPS URLs** for firmware downloads
- Verify firmware checksums before flashing
- Implement rollback mechanisms for failed updates
- Test firmware thoroughly before deployment

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] MQTT over TLS/SSL (port 8883)
