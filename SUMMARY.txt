BLE GATEWAY v1.1.0 - IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT: BLE Gateway for ThingsBoard
AUTHOR: Matt Burton (@mattburt36)
IMPLEMENTED BY: GitHub Copilot Coding Agent
DATE: January 19, 2025
VERSION: 1.1.0 (upgraded from 1.0.0)

================================================================================
PROBLEM STATEMENT ADDRESSED
================================================================================

Original Issue:
"There is a bug with this code, where I'm seeing it drop a connection and need 
to be re-setup, when the mqtt instance is definitely still there."

Requirements:
1. Attempt WiFi connection on startup, setup AP if failed
2. Get timestamp from NTP server once WiFi connected
3. Connect to MQTT and send gateway status (temperature, ESP32 details)
4. Config URL fallback to fetch MQTT credentials if connection fails
5. Multi-threaded operation with separate threads for:
   - MQTT maintenance and keepalives
   - BLE scanning
   - Message processing
6. Encrypted credential storage
7. Modular and straightforward code

================================================================================

TECHNICAL DETAILS
================================================================================

Architecture:
- MQTT Maintenance Task (Core 0, Priority 2)
  * Maintains MQTT connection with keepalives
  * Auto-reconnect every 30 seconds
  * Processes messages and RPC commands
  
- BLE Scanning Task (Core 1, Priority 1)
  * Continuous BLE device discovery
  * Dedicated core for optimal performance
  * Scans every 10 seconds
  
- Message Processing Task (Core 0, Priority 1)
  * Batches BLE device data
  * Publishes to ThingsBoard every 60 seconds
  * Thread-safe buffer access

Thread Safety:
- detectionBufferMutex: Protects BLE device buffer
- mqttMutex: Protects MQTT client operations

Memory Usage:
- Task stacks: 24KB (3 x 8KB)
- MQTT buffer: 8KB
- Free heap: 100-150KB typical

Configuration:
- EEPROM layout extended for new fields
- Passwords encrypted before storage
- Config URL: https://hoptech.co.nz/bgw-config/ (default)

DEPLOYMENT NOTES
================================================================================

Requirements:
- ESP32 board (Xiao Seeed ESP32-S3 or compatible)
- Arduino IDE with ESP32 support
- Required libraries (see README)
- ThingsBoard instance
- Optional: Config server for fallback

Installation:
1. Open BLE-WiFi-Gateway.ino in Arduino IDE
2. Install required libraries
3. Upload to ESP32
4. Connect to "BLE-Gateway-Setup" WiFi (password: 12345678)
5. Configure via web portal at 192.168.4.1
6. Monitor Serial output (115200 baud)

Upgrade from v1.0.0:
1. Backup existing configuration
2. Upload v1.1.0 firmware
3. Configuration should be preserved
4. Optionally set new config URL settings
5. Monitor task startup in Serial output

================================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. XOR Encryption: Basic encryption used. Consider AES for production.
2. No HTTPS Certificate Validation: Config URL doesn't validate certs.
3. Fixed Task Stack Sizes: 8KB per task, may need adjustment.
4. Single MQTT Broker: No multi-broker support.

================================================================================
FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
================================================================================

Recommended for next version:
- AES-256 encryption for credentials
- MQTT over TLS/SSL (port 8883)
- Certificate validation for HTTPS
- Local data caching during outages
- Configurable task parameters via web portal
- Multiple MQTT broker support
