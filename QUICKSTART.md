# Quick Start Guide - Modularized Code

## What Changed?

The single `BLE-WiFi-Gateway.ino` file has been split into 6 organized modules:

```
BLE-Gateway/
├── BLE-WiFi-Gateway.ino    ← Main file (setup & loop)
├── config_manager.h         ← Configuration & storage
├── wifi_manager.h           ← WiFi & web portal
├── ble_scanner.h            ← BLE scanning
├── ota_manager.h            ← Firmware updates
└── mqtt_handler.h           ← MQTT/ThingsBoard
```

## Verify the Structure

Run the validation script:
```bash
./validate.sh
```

Expected output: `✓ All checks passed!`

## Compile the Code

### In Arduino IDE:
1. Open `BLE-WiFi-Gateway.ino`
2. Click **Verify** (✓) or press Ctrl+R
3. Should compile without errors

### Board Settings:
- Board: ESP32 Dev Module
- Upload Speed: 921600
- Flash Size: 4MB
- Partition Scheme: Default 4MB with spiffs

## What to Test

After uploading to your ESP32:

1. **Serial Monitor** (115200 baud):
   - Should see "BLE Gateway Starting..."
   - Tasks should start successfully

2. **WiFi Connection**:
   - Should connect to your network
   - Or create "BLE-Gateway-Setup" AP

3. **MQTT Connection**:
   - Should connect to ThingsBoard
   - Check for "connected!" message

4. **BLE Scanning**:
   - Should detect nearby BLE devices
   - Look for "BLE Advertisement Detected"

5. **Telemetry Publishing**:
   - Every 60 seconds
   - Look for "✓ Telemetry published successfully"

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Compilation Errors?
- See `COMPILATION.md` for troubleshooting

### Runtime Issues?
- Check Serial Monitor output
- Compare with TESTING.md checklist
- Verify all `.h` files are present

## Documentation

- **MODULARIZATION.md** - Detailed module info
- **COMPILATION.md** - Full compilation guide
- **REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md** - What was changed
- **TESTING.md** - Complete test procedures

## Key Points

✅ **Functionality unchanged** - Works exactly like before  
✅ **No config changes** - EEPROM data compatible  
✅ **Same libraries** - No new dependencies  
✅ **Better organized** - Easier to maintain  
✅ **Fully documented** - Comprehensive guides  

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Run `./validate.sh` to check file structure
2. Review compilation output for errors
3. Check Serial Monitor for runtime errors
4. Refer to documentation files
